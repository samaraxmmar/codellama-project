# CodeLlama Project Architecture

This document describes the proposed architecture for the CodeLlama project, including model fine-tuning, dataset management, and the development of a VS Code extension.

## 1. General Repository Structure

The repository will be organized in a modular fashion to facilitate maintenance and scalability. Here is the main folder and file structure:

```
codellama-project/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── main.yml         # CI/CD for tests and deployments
├── data/
│   ├── raw/                 # Raw data
│   └── processed/           # Cleaned and ready-for-fine-tuning data
├── finetuning/
│   ├── scripts/             # Python scripts for fine-tuning
│   │   ├── train.py
│   │   └── evaluate.py
│   └── models/              # Fine-tuned models
├── vscode-extension/
│   ├── src/                 # Extension source code
│   ├── package.json         # Extension metadata and dependencies
│   └── README.md            # Extension documentation
├── notebooks/               # Jupyter notebooks for exploration and experimentation
├── docs/                    # Additional documentation (e.g., tutorials)
├── .gitignore               # Files and folders to be ignored by Git
├── README.md                # General project description
├── requirements.txt         # Python dependencies
└── ARCHITECTURE.md          # This document
```

## 2. Main Components

### 2.1. `data/` Module

This module will handle the ingestion, cleaning, and preparation of data for CodeLlama model fine-tuning. It will include:

*   **`raw/`**: Contains raw datasets downloaded or collected.
*   **`processed/`**: Contains data after preprocessing, formatted for use by fine-tuning scripts. This will likely include JSON Lines files or similar formats.

### 2.2. `finetuning/` Module

This module is the core of the project for model training. It will contain:

*   **`scripts/`**: Python scripts to orchestrate the fine-tuning process. `train.py` will be responsible for training the model on the prepared dataset, and `evaluate.py` for evaluating the performance of the fine-tuned model.
*   **`models/`**: The directory where fine-tuned model checkpoints will be saved.

### 2.3. `vscode-extension/` Module

This module will encapsulate the VS Code extension that will interact with the fine-tuned CodeLlama model. Features could include code autocompletion, code generation, or refactoring. It will contain:

*   **`src/`**: The extension's source code, likely written in TypeScript or JavaScript.
*   **`package.json`**: The extension manifest, defining its properties, dependencies, and entry points.
*   **`README.md`**: Specific documentation for the extension, explaining its installation and usage.

## 3. Dependencies and Technologies

The project will rely on the following technologies:

*   **Base Model**: CodeLlama (via Hugging Face Transformers).
*   **Deep Learning Framework**: PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on the fine-tuning script implementation choice).
*   **Data Management**: Pandas, NumPy.
*   **VS Code Extension Development**: Node.js, npm/yarn, TypeScript/JavaScript.
*   **Development Tools**: Git, Docker (for environment reproducibility).

## 4. Proposed Workflow

1.  **Data Preparation**: Collect raw data, clean and preprocess it to create the final dataset in `data/processed/`.
2.  **Model Fine-tuning**: Execute `finetuning/scripts/train.py` to train CodeLlama on the prepared dataset. The fine-tuned model is saved in `finetuning/models/`.
3.  **Model Evaluation**: Use `finetuning/scripts/evaluate.py` to evaluate model performance.
4.  **VS Code Extension Development**: Implement extension features, which could call the fine-tuned model via a local API or service.
5.  **Testing and CI/CD**: Set up unit and integration tests, and configure CI/CD workflows in `.github/workflows/` to automate testing and deployments.

This document will serve as a roadmap for project development. Updates will be made as progress continues.
